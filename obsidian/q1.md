the sent by relation does not have total participation as when a user is deleted, the message's sent by field will be set to null indication the message was sent by a deleted user

the chats ISA constraint is not overlaping as a chat can be only a channel, group or direct message but not multiple and it is covering because it must always be one of the three

another thing not modeled is the join links on the groups. this is because we are using the format http://sitename/join_chat/<chat_id> as our join links so links are already stored as the id of the chat
