# q1

the chats ISA constraint is not overlaping as a chat can be only a channel, group or direct message but not multiple and it is covering because it must be one of the three

another thing not modeled is the join links on the groups. this is because we are using the format http://sitename/join_chat/<chat_id> as our join links so links are already stored as the id of the chat
