Files(**<ins>fild_id: INTEGER</ins>**, file_name: TEXT, contents: BLOB)

F(i, n, c)

i -> i, n, c

this is in BCNF as the only fd is the min key

---

Users(**<ins>user_id: INTEGER</ins>**, phone_number: TEXT, name: TEXT, email: TEXT, location: TEXT, username: TEXT, password: TEXT, bio: TEXT, availability: INTEGER, pfp_file_id: INTEGER)

U(id, pn, n, e, l, u, p, b, a)

id -> id, pn, n, e, l, u, p, b, a
pn -> id, pn, n, e, l, u, p, b, a
e  -> id, pn, n, e, l, u, p, b, a
u  -> id, pn, n, e, l, u, p, b, a

id, pn, e, and u are all minimum candidate keys and are the only FDs on the relation so this relation is in BCNF

---

Contacts(**<ins>user_id: INTEGER, contact_user_id: INTEGER</ins>**)

C(u, c)

u, c -> u, c

the only members of this relation are part of the minimum candidate key, this relation is in BCNF

---

Messages(**<ins>message_id:INTEGER</ins>**, message: TEXT, reply_to: INTEGER, attachment: INTEGER, timestamp: BIGINT, last_edited: BIGINT, sender_id: INTEGER, chat_id INTEGER, views: INTEGER, pinned: boolean)

M(id, m, r, a, t, l, s, c, v, b)

id -> id, m, r, a, t, l, s, c, v, b

the only FD within this relation is id which is the min key therefore it is in BCNF

---

Chats (**<ins>chat_id: INTEGER</ins>**, primary_owner: INTEGER, secondary_owner: INTEGER, sending_privilage: INTEGER, track_views: BOOLEAN, max_members INTEGER, chat_name text)

CH(id, p, sec, sen, t, m, c)

id -> id, p, sec, sen, t, m, c

the only FD within this relation is id which is the min key therefore it is in BCNF

---

Chat_Members (**<ins>chat_id: INTEGER, member_id: INTEGER</ins>**, privilage: INTEGER, wants_notifications: BOOLEAN, last_seen INTEGER,)

CM(c, m, p, w, l)

c,m -> c, m, p, w, l

since c,m is the minimum candidate key and the only FD that holds this relation is in BCNF
