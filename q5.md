a. Retrieve the list of all users

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

b. Retrieve the list of all online users.

availability is one when the user is online, we have availability as an integer instead of a boolean to allow for a user to set it to do not disturb or invisible (always appearing offline)

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE availability = 1;
```

c. Given a user (by phone number or unique ID or username), retrieve all information of the user.

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = ___ OR phone_number = ___ OR username = ___;
```

d. Given a user (by phone number, unique ID or username) retrieve all his/her chats (private chats, normal groups and channels)

```sql
SELECT chats.* FROM chats INNER JOIN chat_members ON chats.chat_id=chat_members.chat_id AND chat_members.member_id = __;
```

e. For a given chat, retrieve its metadata (chat title, bio, join link (if applicable), etc.)

for our production database we are just using the id of a chat as its join link

```sql
SELECT (chat_id, primary_owner, secondary_owner, sending_privilage, track_views, max_members, chat_name) FROM chats where chat_id = __;
```
